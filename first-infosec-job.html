                            <p class="lead mb-4">My first real "InfoSec" job was with TraceSecurity, a company based out of Baton Rouge, LA. Prior to landing this job, I had worked as a PC Technician, Help Desk Technician, and Systems Administrator for various local companies.</p>
                            
                            <p>In each of my previous jobs, I tried to focus on learning the security aspects of these roles. When I worked as a PC Tech, I was in charge of imaging machines and setting up antivirus, patch management, and security. When I worked as a helpdesk technician, I became interested in things like Active Directory permissions and access control. When I was a sysadmin, I was in charge of ensuring all of our systems were up-to-date and secured properly.</p>
                            
                            <div class="story-blockquote my-5" data-aos="fade-up">
                                <p>Even before my first dedicated cybersecurity role, I was constantly finding ways to incorporate security principles into whatever position I held. This natural gravitation toward security prepared me for my first official InfoSec job.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>I eventually found a company that allowed me to contribute as a Security Analyst. I found this job through a website called SimplyHired, and I applied not meeting the "required experience." The job description literally said "3+ years of experience in IT security required." I had less than 2 years of experience, and most of it wasn't even dedicated security experience. But I still applied anyway. In the application, I talked about how I had learned security on my own and was obtaining certifications, including OSCP.</p>
                            
                            <p>A few weeks went by and I received a phone call from the hiring manager. After our first conversation, I received a contingent job offer. If I could meet their "1 month trial," I would be able to stay on with the company. The starting salary (which today can be much higher than these numbers) was around 40k. I was stoked. I accepted the position, and this officially launched my cybersecurity career.</p>
                            
                            <p>The CEO of this company saw potential in me. He was also a tech guy, an engineer, and not simply a businessman. The connection we had was very real, and he took a risk as I had no security experience, and frankly, he made the right bet. I proved my value, saved the company money, worked hard, and built my experience at that company. I'm forever grateful for this opportunity from TraceSecurity.</p>
