                        Getting into Cybersecurity: My First Infosec Job
                    </p>
                    
                   <div class="clear"></div>    

                    <div class="two_third">
                        <div class="medium-text">
                            One of the most common questions I get is, “How did you get started in Infosec?” 
                        </div>

                        <br>
                        <p>Other than technical college, one of the things that I seriously embraced was getting certifications through vendors such as Microsoft, <a class="story-text" href="#" target="_blank">CompTIA</a>, CIW, Cisco, eLearnSecurity, and Offensive Security. Since I could control the pace at which I obtained these certifications, this was my preferred route.</p>

<blockquote>From the time I started at Louisiana Technical College until I finished, I had obtained my A+, Security+, and Network+, and two MCTS certifications -- one for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7.</blockquote>

<p>I finally landed my first IT job with the help of one of my instructors and it paid minimum wage. After a few months, it became too slow and I was laid off and had a job at LSU a week or two later, doing very basic help desk work and a little bit of administration with servers. After I graduated with my technical diploma, I did a little bit more work with LSU (an extended contract) and eventually started working at a federal credit union in IT.</p>

<p>Working in IT at the federal credit union has taught me a lot about how a real IT department is run at an organization. I learned a lot more about networking and virtualization, although I couldn't keep myself out of Backtrack (now known as Kali Linux). Eventually we hired a cybersecurity firm to come in and do a yearly security assessment. When they came in, I applied for an open position over there. By this time, this was actually my second or third year applying to work there and I guess my persistence paid off. I started doing very basic IT stuff, but I was surrounded by cybersecurity analysts. Every chance I got, I got involved with what assessments they were doing and learned as much as possible. I also used my free time to take and pass my CCENT and CCNA within my first few months of starting.</p>

<p>When an opportunity opened up in the compliance associate role, I was the first person considered since I had already been pretty involved with the process. The path to growth was extremely clear for me.
</p>

<blockquote>Going from the compliance associate role to an analyst position only took a few months, and this is when I was in my first “infosec” position.</blockquote>


<p>During my time being surrounded by other analysts, I learned as much as I could and also embraced the opportunity to take the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) certification, followed by my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).</p>

<p>After taking my OSCP, the rest was history. Opportunities opened up left and right and I became part of a badass team and just continued to work, code, and learn as much as I could for the next several years.</p>
