                            <p class="lead mb-4">My journey to cybersecurity began with a solid educational foundation at Louisiana Technical College, where I earned several key certifications: A+, Security+, Network+, and two Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) certifications for Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="text-accent mt-5 mb-3">Early Career Challenges</h4>
                            <p>My first IT job was a minimum wage position that unfortunately ended in a layoff. This setback didn't discourage me—instead, it motivated me to keep building my skills and experience. I then moved to Louisiana State University, where I worked in help desk support and basic server administration, gaining valuable hands-on experience in IT operations.</p>
                            
                            <p>From LSU, I transitioned to a federal credit union, working in their IT department. This role expanded my knowledge significantly, particularly in networking and virtualization technologies. During this time, I continued exploring security tools like Kali Linux (then called Backtrack), keeping my passion for cybersecurity alive while gaining practical IT experience.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="text-accent mt-5 mb-3">Breaking into TraceSecurity</h4>
                            <p>The turning point came while I was working at the federal credit union. TraceSecurity, a cybersecurity firm based in Baton Rouge, was brought in to conduct our yearly security assessment. I was immediately fascinated by their work and knew this was where I wanted to be. This wasn't my first attempt to join TraceSecurity—by this time, it was actually my second or third year applying to work there. My persistence finally paid off when they offered me a position.</p>
                            
                            <p>I started at TraceSecurity in a basic helpdesk role, but I was surrounded by cybersecurity analysts who became my informal mentors. I absorbed everything I could learn from them, constantly asking questions and observing their work. Within my first few months at TraceSecurity, I obtained both my CCENT and CCNA certifications, demonstrating my commitment to rapid skill development.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="text-accent mt-5 mb-3">Career Progression at TraceSecurity</h4>
                            <p>My dedication at TraceSecurity quickly led to a promotion from the help desk role to a compliance associate position. From there, the transition to my first official analyst position happened remarkably fast.</p>
                            
                            <div class="story-blockquote my-5" data-aos="fade-up">
                                <p>"Going from the compliance associate role to an analyst position only took a few months, and this is when I was in my first 'infosec' position."</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>This analyst role at TraceSecurity marked my true entry into the cybersecurity field.</p>
                            
                            <p>While at TraceSecurity, I continued to pursue advanced certifications. I earned the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) and later the highly respected Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). The OSCP certification was particularly transformative—after obtaining it, opportunities became much more abundant.</p>
                            
                            <p>My time at TraceSecurity was invaluable. I worked alongside what I can only describe as a "badass team" of talented professionals who taught me the fundamentals of penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security consulting. This experience at TraceSecurity laid the foundation for everything that would follow in my cybersecurity career, ultimately leading me to start my own company years later.</p>
