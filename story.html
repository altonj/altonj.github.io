                <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">My journey didn't start in a boardroom or a high-tech lab. It started in New Orleans, raised by a single mother who taught me the value of resilience early on.</p>
                
                <p>When I was 11, life took a sharp turn when my father passed away. That same year, I was introduced to computers, and they became my outlet—a way to "figure out life" through logic and code. While other kids were outside, I was learning to hack and write scripts, finding a sense of control in the digital world.</p>

                <p>Then came Hurricane Katrina. The displacement and chaos that followed could have easily derailed everything, but I stayed focused. Shortly after the storm, I obtained my GED from Louisiana Technical College at 16, determined to turn my obsession with technology into a career.</p>
                
                <p>I spent the next decade in the trenches of cybersecurity, working my way up from an IT technician to a Principal Security Consultant for some of the world's largest firms. I saw the same manual, time-consuming problems being solved over and over again, and I knew there was a better way.</p>

                <p>I took everything I had learned and started Vonahi Security to build what people told me was impossible. We didn't just build a tool; we changed how the industry viewed security testing. That vision eventually led to our acquisition by Kaseya, proving that a kid from NOLA with a laptop and a lot of grit could change the game.</p>
